## All Next Projects

1. first-next (FN)
   A. to create next app run the command `npm install react react-dom next`
   B. the scripts added to package.json:
   "scripts": {
   "dev": "next",
   "build": "next build",
   "start": "next start"
   },
   C. `npm run dev` or `npm run start` throws an error
   D. create "pages" directory under the project root folder
   E: Next creates automatically routes for every file under the "pages" folder. We do not have to use react router, we don not have to define routes explicitly.
